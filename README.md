# Are rain gauges in the right place?
Collection of code written as part of Bachelor Thesis Civil Engineering:  'Are raingauges in the right place?' - March 2022

Folder each consist of a different part of the research (in order of refactoring):

#### _unused:_
- Distance building: Loads in shapedata for buildings and computes the distance to buidlings (exploring use of shapely)
#### _Used:_
- Distance stations: loads in gauge locations, looks at the distances between rain gauge stations (basic intro)
- Difference Contour and DEM: Loads in results from contour and DEM analysis, merges the dataframes and creates plots (plots)
